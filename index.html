    expectations in terms of placement availability. As a department we are currently implementing a new placement system, and part<br>

<div class="jobtitle">Placement Administrator, UOS</div> 
<div class ="jobdesc">My role in the Placement Administrator team is to enhance the student experience of their practice placements, through effective communication with internal colleagues, practice placement partners and individual students.  The day-to-day responsibilities include answering telephone and email enquiries from both students, practice and internal colleagues, data entry of student timesheets, monitoring of student attendance and producing reports relating to student hours, absences, and placement audits. </div>

<div class="jobtitle">Administration Assistant, S&P</div> 
<div class ="jobdesc">S&P is an international ventilation manufacturer, and my role here was varied and fast paced. My main responsibility was to ensure that orders from distributors were processed and dispatched in a timely manner. This included liaising with the factory in Spain and keeping in touch with the out of office sales representatives, to make sure their projects arrived to site on time. I monitored the back orders with the factory and ran reports to check stock levels, whilst also managing customer queries over the phone and giving technical advice when needed. I also created and sent invoices, managed the customer database using the in-house system and filed paperwork when needed. During my employment, I changed the way in which orders are filed from a paper system to a paperless one, and also created a systems user guide that I used to train new members of staff.</div>
